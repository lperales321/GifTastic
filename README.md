A pre-defined group of buttons is displayed with horror movie characters.
When you click a button, ten images are returned.
Add another character and click the Submit button to add it to the list.

When you click on an image, it will be animated.
When you click on it again, it will stop.

NOTE: The image onClick event is not getting triggered when clicking on an image.
The image does have the class used on the onClick event. I am not sure why it's not triggering.
I think it has to do with the ordering of the function and events.

I did add the logic to swap between animate and still image, but cannot trigger it.
